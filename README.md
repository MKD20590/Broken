## 🔴About
“BROKEN” is a psychological horror puzzle-adventure where you play as a child trapped in a warped world fabricated by their fractured mind. You will be chained by your tragic past memories and you must confront each one to get the heart pieces and use them to snap back to reality. I created all the scripts, here are some details about Broken's development
